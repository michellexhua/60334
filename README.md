Michelle Hua

Includes login feature where there is an encryption system for both adminsitrators and members. Users have the ability to register and become a member. Members have a dashboard where they can view the history of books borrowed, and books that have not been returned. Admins have a dashboard to view the number of books, authors and categories listed, as well as the number of books issued and returned. They can also view the number of registered users, and have the ability to add additional books, authors and categories. They can also assign books, and charge fees to members who returned their books late. Lastly, both admin and members have the ability to change their password. 

The database of the Windsor Library Management System was created using phpMyAdmin and coded with SQL. The web was created using MyWeb, coded with PHP, HTML, CSS, javascript, and Bootstrap.
